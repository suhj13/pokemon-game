5. The NPC. 
    Notes (What I want the NPC to do)
    - Make a team that is super effective against each member of my team.
        - Iterate through my team and find a pokemon in the database that is super effective against each member.
        - Add to list once found in the database.

    - Makes a little bit of decision making based on the situation it is in.
        - If the NPC's pokemon is strong defensively against my pokemon, attack it.
        - If not, then switch out. 

6. Database development
    - Find a way to add stats to each Pokemon by scraping data from serebii.net.
    - Could do the above with moves as well.
